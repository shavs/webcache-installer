      <p>
        This is to download single webpages. This has two benefits:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The page can be viewed as though it were the original page,
          hosted from the server with almost all resources available</li>
          <li>The page can be viewed anywhen and can be rehosted on a private server</li>
      </ol>
